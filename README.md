# aliases

Collection of personal shell aliases that I like.

## Usage

The relevant file with the aliases is 'source/aliases.sh'.
You can simply source the aliases.sh file to make your shell use it.

Add 'source /path/to/aliases.sh' to the end of one of the following files:

- /etc/profile
- /etc/bashrc
- /etc/zsh/zshrc
- ~/.bashrc
- ~/.zshrc
- ~/.profile
- ~/.zprofile

...and so on.
